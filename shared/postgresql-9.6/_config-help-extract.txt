`configure' configures PostgreSQL 9.6.2 to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          [/usr/local/pgsql]

By default, `make install' will install all the files in
`/usr/local/pgsql/bin', `/usr/local/pgsql/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than `/usr/local/pgsql' using `--prefix',
for instance `--prefix=$HOME'.

Optional Packages:
  --with-includes=DIRS    look for additional header files in DIRS
  --with-libraries=DIRS   look for additional libraries in DIRS
  --with-pgport=PORTNUM   set default port number [5432]
  --with-perl             build Perl modules (PL/Perl)
  --with-python           build Python modules (PL/Python)
  --with-pam              build with PAM support
  --with-openssl          build with OpenSSL support
  --with-systemd          build with systemd support
  --with-libxml           build with XML support
  --with-libxslt          use XSLT support when building contrib/xml2

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP         C preprocessor
  LDFLAGS_EX  extra linker flags for linking executables only
  LDFLAGS_SL  extra linker flags for linking shared libraries only
  DOCBOOKSTYLE
              location of DocBook stylesheets

Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
